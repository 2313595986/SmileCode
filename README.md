## ðŸ§  Method
### Frame work
- **Feature Extraction:** Two ResNet extract features from different modalities and fuse corrective features using the attention module.
- **Segmentor:** A few shot segmentation paradigm is used to implement the segmentation task to enhance the encoder's ability to extract features. Optimize prototypes with the Prototype Correction Module.
- **Classifier:** Performs classification tasks and generates grad-cam maps to indicate suspicious areas.

### Module
- **Attention:** Dimensional Attention Module utilizes dimension-wise attention to re-weight the features and fuses the re-weighted features afterwards. Adaptive Spatial Attention Module aggregates the features from two modalities in pixel-level.
- **Prototype Correction:** It refines the support prototype by query features without introducing extra training parameters.
